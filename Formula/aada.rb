  # NOTE: Update the url and sha256 to match the macOS ARM64 artifact when you cut a new release.
  # The build system produces separate ZIPs per platform, named like:
  #   aada_mac_arm64.zip, aada_mac_x64.zip, aada_win_x64.zip, ...
  # Prefer arm64 for Apple Silicon. If you need Intel, change to aada_mac_x64.zip and sha256.
